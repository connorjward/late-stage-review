\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have presented \pyop3, a new library for automating the application of stencil computations over a mesh.
Its interface takes inspiration from DMPlex to provide the user with a concise and composable way to express stencils and it has a novel data layout abstraction permitting a range of possible optimisations and mathematical methods.
Basing much of its design on PETSc, and through code generation, \pyop3 achieves significant flexibility in only a very small amount of code.
